- 👋 Hi, I’m @BubbleCipherStudios, a developer who is looking to expand my knowledge
- 👀 I’m interested in python programming and kivy
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create exe files from a python file project
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating apps and games
- 📫 How to reach me --> Email: BubbleCipherStudios@gmail.com

I have been on and off programming for a few years as a minor hobby and have recently
decided to go back in at full force. I will be using this Github as base of operations
for all of my public side projects I do for fun. I have some experience in software
engineering/planning from my university projects and look forward to what more the
future has in store.
